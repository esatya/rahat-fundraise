Here, the fundraiser can start a fundraising campaign and raise fund for the relief. Similarly, Donors can read out the need and donate to the beneficiary directly, without having to go through multiple organizations in the middle. The fund will instantly be transferred through the blockchain network. Blockchain will make the whole process secure and efficient along with cheaper or free transaction fees.
